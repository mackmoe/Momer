I got sick of blowing away my shit and having to build stuff from scratch. Most this stuff is inspired by a need, then by borrowing ideas from other people. So now, I'm using this repo to save all my work done on my home dashboard. I aslo hope I am also able to lrean some things from this experience.




## Deployment

To deploy any compose stack from this project, cd into the stack you want to create. 

However, this stack should always be running and accessable to edit in the docker compose data dir for homer 


## Acknowledgements

Mostly born out of boredom and my quest for learning new shit, I borrowed a lot of ideas for this from work and legit DevOps blogs
