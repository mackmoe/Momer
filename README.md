I got sick of blowing away my stuff and having to build everything from scratch again... and again. So I decided to give [Bastien Wirtz's](https://github.com/bastienwirtz) [Homer Dashboard](https://github.com/bastienwirtz/homer) a try and I'm loving how simple it is! 

I'm using this repo (linked) to a live self hosted docker instance, to keep track of what I build and add onto my custom verion of this awesome dashboard.


## Deployment

This app stack is running on docker compose. The deployment included NodeRed because of [what I found here](https://flows.nodered.org/flow/4b6406c9a684c26ace0430dd1826e95d). For a live view at my current dashboard, [just click here](https://dashboard.molovestoshare.com/). 


## Acknowledgements

Mostly born out of boredom and my thirst for learning new things and (of course) building stuff, I borrowed a lot of ideas for this from what I do at work (DevOps)..
